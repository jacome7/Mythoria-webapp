- Click "Add New Price" to test modal tracking
- Create or edit pricing entries to test event tracking

## 📊 Available Tracking Functions

Import and use these functions anywhere in your app:

```tsx
import { trackEvent } from '../components/GoogleAnalytics';

// Track custom events
trackEvent('user_action', {
  action_type: 'button_click',
  page: 'homepage'
});
```

## 🎯 Common Events to Track

Consider adding tracking for:
- User registration/login
- Story creation/editing
- Character creation
- E-book generation
- Credit purchases
- Search queries
- Error occurrences

## 🔍 Verification

Your Google Analytics is properly configured when you see:
1. Real-time users in your GA4 dashboard
2. Page views being recorded
3. Custom events (like pricing actions) appearing in GA4

The integration is production-ready and will automatically start tracking once you deploy with the environment variable set!
