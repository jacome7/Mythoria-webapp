# Clean leads and newsletter signup
On the beginning of my project I had a form to allow users to signup their email so we could notify them when we released the application.
But now, we have removed (hide) that feature, so I want now to remove all the code related with that, namely the component C:\Mythoria\mythoria-webapp\src\components\EmailSignup.tsx and the /api/leads.

Delete all code related with those removed features.

PLEASE ANALYZE VERY CAREFULLY WHAT AS BEEN REQUESTED.
LOOK THROUGHLY INTO THE EXISTING CODE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT EXISTS.
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR SUGGESTIONS, PLEASE ASK (PROMPT) ME BEFORE START CODING.
