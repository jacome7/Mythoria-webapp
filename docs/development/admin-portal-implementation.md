# Admin Portal Implementation

## Overview
A secure admin portal has been implemented for the Mythoria platform, accessible only to authorized users with specific Clerk metadata.

## Route Information
- **URL**: `/portaldegestao` (Portuguese for "management portal" to reduce visibility to potential attackers)
- **Location**: Outside the locale folder structure (`src/app/portaldegestao/`) so it's not translated
- **Access Control**: Requires specific Clerk public metadata

## Admin Portal Pages

### 1. Dashboard (`/portaldegestao`)
- Main admin portal landing page
- Shows overview and main KPIs
- Currently displays "Admin Portal - Dashboard" header

### 2. Users (`/portaldegestao/users`)
- User management interface
- List and manage all platform users
- Currently displays "Admin Portal - Users" header

### 3. Stories (`/portaldegestao/stories`)
- Story management interface
- List all stories created on the platform
- Currently displays "Admin Portal - Stories" header

### 4. Payments (`/portaldegestao/payments`)
- Payment management interface
- Check all payments received
- Currently displays "Admin Portal - Payments" header

## Access Requirements
Users must meet the following criteria to access the admin portal:

1. **Must be signed in** via Clerk authentication
2. **Must have the required public metadata**:
   ```json
   {
     "autorizaçãoDeAcesso": "Comejá"
   }
   ```

## Security Features
- **Automatic Redirect**: Users who don't meet the access criteria are automatically redirected to the homepage
- **Client-side Validation**: The page validates user credentials on the client side before rendering any content
- **Loading State**: Shows a loading spinner while authentication status is being verified
- **Obscured Route Name**: Uses Portuguese naming to make the admin route less obvious to potential attackers

## Components Created

### 1. AdminPortal Page (`src/app/portaldegestao/page.tsx`)
- Main admin portal page component
- Handles access control logic
- Renders admin header, content area, and footer

### 2. AdminHeader Component (`src/components/AdminHeader.tsx`)
- Simplified header for admin pages
- Contains Mythoria logo (left) and Clerk UserButton (right)
- No navigation menu (can be added later as needed)

### 3. AdminFooter Component (`src/components/AdminFooter.tsx`)
- Simple footer for admin pages
- Contains copyright notice indicating authorized access only

## Technical Implementation

### Middleware Updates
- Updated `src/middleware.ts` to exclude `/portaldegestao` from internationalization
- Ensures the admin route bypasses locale-based routing

### Authentication Flow
1. Page loads and checks if Clerk is loaded
2. Verifies user is signed in
3. Checks user's public metadata for required authorization
4. Redirects to homepage if any check fails
5. Renders admin content only for authorized users

### TypeScript Compliance
- All components use proper TypeScript typing
- Metadata typing uses `{ [key: string]: string }` instead of `any`
- ESLint compliant code

## Current Status
- ✅ Route created and accessible
- ✅ Access control implemented
- ✅ Basic admin header and footer created
- ✅ Middleware updated to bypass internationalization
- ✅ TypeScript and build errors resolved
- ✅ Development server running successfully

## Future Enhancements
The admin portal is now ready for additional features such as:
- User management interface
- Story moderation tools
- Analytics dashboard
- System configuration panels
- Content management tools

## Testing the Implementation
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/portaldegestao`
2. Without proper authorization, you'll be redirected to the homepage
3. With proper Clerk metadata, you'll see the "Admin Portal" page with the admin header and footer

## Security Notes
- The route name uses Portuguese to reduce discoverability
- Access is strictly controlled via Clerk metadata
- No sensitive information is exposed to unauthorized users
- The page doesn't render any content until authorization is confirmed
