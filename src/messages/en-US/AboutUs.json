    "intro": "Mythoria was born from something real simple: a passion for stories. The kind they told us at bedtime and the kind that, even as adults, make us daydream. We believe, from the bottom of our hearts, that everyone has a special story inside them, just waiting for a chance to shine.",

    "paragraph1": "Our dream is to see a child's eyes light up reading a book they helped create. To see an adult smile, rediscovering that spark of imagination that sometimes the daily grind makes us forget.",
    "paragraph2": "We created Mythoria to be that bridge. A safe and magical bridge between your idea — no matter how small, like a doodle or a memory — and an illustrated book, real and tangible, that you can keep forever. We want creating a book to be an act of joy, not a challenge."
